Observations from study:
1. Capomulin was consistently one of the top two Drug Regimens to treat Tumor Volume in regards to size as compared
to the whole group of ten Drug Regimens.
2. These results appear to be reliable as the mouse sample size for each Drug Regimen was about the same at 25 mice each.
3. There were no quantifiable outliers for Capomulin.
4. Tumor volume reduced in size by about half after 45 days of treatment with Capomulin.
5. Mouse weight appears to have a positive correlation to Tumor Volume Average size.
